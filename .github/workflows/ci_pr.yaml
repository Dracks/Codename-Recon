            # When using "Squash and merge" on a PR with only one commit, GitHub
            # will suggest using that commit message instead of the PR title for the
            # merge commit, and it's easy to commit this by mistake. Enable this option
            # to also validate the commit message for one commit PRs.

            # title matches a single commit to avoid confusion.
